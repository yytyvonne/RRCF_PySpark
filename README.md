## Project title:

Implementation of the Robust Random Cut Forest algorithm for Online Anomaly Detection over Streaming Data

## Summary:

In this project we are interested in building an architecture to conduct real-time anomaly detection on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) virtual machines. It is well known that such functionality is provided exclusively on Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics. However, it is beneficial to develop this model on GCP for stakeholders who already have existing data infrastructures on GCP and are seeking to employ large-scale anomaly detection on streaming data. The algorithm that we are mainly focusing on in the project would be Robust Random Cut Forest which is developed by Guha. Due to the lack of true labelled data, we are going to inject simulated anomalies to the original data in the historical U.S. stock prices data set.
